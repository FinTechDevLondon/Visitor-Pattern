Visitor Pattern Experiments with C++ 20

Licence Conditions:

If you are using my work for non-cmomercial purposes, then it is free to use. You may modify it in any way you see fit. If you re-distribute it I ask that the licence terms are retained and acknowledgement to the author is given.

If you are using my work for commercial purposes, then please contact me and I will charge a consultancy fee after which you may use it in any way you see fit.

If my work helps you obtain a job or education (for example if you use it to boost your CV) then I ask that you buy me a G&T which at current London prices and FX rates is about $6.77.

Thanks!
